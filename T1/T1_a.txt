Given these clear distinctions in the accelerometer data, it is likely that a machine learning model could effectively classify these activities based on the recorded data. The model could learn to recognize the patterns associated with each activity and accurately differentiate between them.





 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Static activities show low, stable linear acceleration, while dynamic activities have higher, variable values. This clear separation could allow simple threshold-based methods to differentiate static from dynamic activities, but a machine-learning model would offer better accuracy and nuance in classification.

1.c) PCA on TSFEL features offers better visualization than PCA on raw total acceleration data. The TSFEL features result in a clearer separation of activities, while the raw data shows significant overlap and less distinct clustering. Therefore, applying feature extraction before PCA provides more meaningful visual differentiation between classes.
